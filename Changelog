0.3.1 [03/18/2012]
  Root contexts were kind of a dumb idea it turns out. Found an alternate way to
    implement similar functionality.
0.3.0 [03/07/2012]
  Change log started. Better late than never.
  Removed deprecated "setup" and "teardown" methods.
  Introduced the concept of a root context so "before" and "after" methods can
    exist outside of a declared context.
  Replaced the ill-conceived "and" method with "and_also" courtesy @gma.
