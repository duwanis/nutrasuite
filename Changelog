0.3.0 [03/07/2012]
  Change log started. Better late than never.
	Removed deprecated "setup" and "teardown" methods.
	Introduced the concept of a root context so "before" and "after" methods can
	  exist outside of a declared context.
	Replaced the ill-conceived "and" method with "and_also" courtesy @gma.
