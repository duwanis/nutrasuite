          <h1>Nutrasuite</h1>

<p>A low-calorie sweetener for your minitests.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>We really like using Minitest, and really didn't like the fact that
contexts for your tests weren't built in. So we wrote Nutrasuite.</p>

<h3>OH NO ANOTHER TEST FRAMEWORK WHY ARGHUBUGAJKGAaSDFAWEGSGA</h3>

<p>Nope. Just something to make working with minitest a little easier.</p>

<h3>Why don't you just use RSpec or Minitest::Spec?</h3>

<p>Because monkeying with the object namespace just to write tests makes us feel dirty in all the wrong ways.</p>

<h3>Why don't you just use shoulda-context?</h3>

<p>Because it pretty much seems to have been deprecated, so we'd rather take a few
minutes to put something together that we can maintain.</p>

<h3>Why haven't you used [something else]?</h3>

<p>Because we haven't heard of it, or it didn't work, or it wasn't available as a
proper gem anymore.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Although there may be some more niceties added in the future, right now
Nutrasuite is all about contexts. Write your tests like so:</p>

<pre><code>require 'nutrasuite'
class SomeTest &lt; MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
  a "newly instantiated test object" do
    before do
      some_setup_stuff
    end

    it "tests for stuff" do
      assert true
    end

    after do
      some_teardown_stuff
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>All of your other minitest stuff should work normally. Context
before/after blocks are executed once for each test, so the randomization built into
minitest will still work as you'd expect.</p>

<p><code>a</code>, <code>an</code>, <code>and_also</code>, <code>the</code>, and <code>that</code> all define contexts, so you can build
readable sentences like "<em>a</em> user <em>that</em> has an expired password <em>and_also</em> a bad
email address" or "<em>the</em> singleton."</p>

<p><code>it</code> defines tests; <code>it_eventually</code> defines tests that are to be skipped.</p>

<h2>Get it</h2>

<p>It's a gem named nutrasuite. Install it and make it available however
you prefer.</p>

<p>If you want to use it you'll at least need Ruby 1.9. Other than that it should
be compatible with anything that works with MiniTest; we're not currently aware
of any conflicts.</p>

<h2>Contributions</h2>

<p>If Nutrasuite interests you and you think you might want to contribute, hit me up
over Github. You can also just fork it and make some changes, but there's a
better chance that your work won't be duplicated or rendered obsolete if you
check in on the current development status first.
Gem requirements/etc. should be handled by Bundler.</p>
